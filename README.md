## Intro

Vue.js is a library for building interactive web interfaces. It provides data-reactive components with a simple and flexible API. Core features include:

- [Dead simple, unobtrusive reactivity using plain JavaScript objects.](http://vuejs.org/guide/overview.html#Reactive-Data-Binding)
- [Component-oriented development style with tooling support](http://vuejs.org/guide/overview.html#Component-System)
- Lean and extensible core
- [Flexible transition effect system](http://vuejs.org/guide/transitions.html)
- Fast without the need for complex optimization

Note that Vue.js only supports [ES5-compliant browsers](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE8 and below are not supported). To check out live examples and docs, visit [vuejs.org](http://vuejs.org).
